    <h1>ACTIVITY 1 (Introduction)</h1>
    

    <p>	My name is Gabriel Lorenzo P. Pasaporte, I am from Para√±aque City, and have lived there ever since I was born. My family kept moving from place to place before my birth, but they have settled down ever since. I will never forget about the enrollment of my 3rd semester last year. When I was about to ride a jeep on my way to school, I got hit by a motorcycle. My foot hurt so much, but I neglected the pain and told the driver I was alright. I sat at the sidewalk and later continued to commute to school. I still remember the people at Magallanes as I limp my way to school and thought of how can these people laugh at a person injured. When I got to school, I went to the clinic and got first aid. They called my house and my cousin came to school, but I still insisted on enrolling, so they lent me a wheelchair and my cousin assisted me. After enrolling we immediately go home. The pain was so excruciating that even lying down was painful. I had an injury for 4 months, and even now I could still feel the faint pain. I have learned many things because of this experience, and I am very thankful for those that helped me throughout the hardships of my disability.</p>

    <p>I am looking forward to learning more this semester than the past semester where I had trouble walking. And I am expecting a fun and engaging subject where I can learn skills applicable and enjoyable throughout the whole term. I don't have a general idea of what we are going to encounter throughout our lessons in our USERDES subject, but I really want to learn to improve user interfaces, especially with my course. I believe the overall user interface of an application is critical for people to actually enjoy using an application. And as a future developer, I really want this set of skills for my future projects.</p>
